Session title:
Building the Publishing Platform for Live Coding

Intro:
I came up with the idea for CodeCook.live when I was [live posting to Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/johnnybuilds.bsky.social/post/3lct4orsaqc25) some code for a project. Sharing my coding process in real-time was a lot of fun. It got me thinking...

What if there was a platform that allowed me to share what I was working on while I was working on it, but didn't get in the way? A place where I could showcase my work and get immediate feedback. 

Notes:

V0 makes it really easy to spin up UI so I [gave it a prompt](https://v0.dev/chat/OMHzSZls86A?b=b_kYHGhXeupDf):

> Landing page for CodeCook.live, a site for live coding in post thread format. Share and learn with the community as you build in public.

It spit out a landing page with Header, Hero, Features, HowItWorks, CommunityShowcase, CallToAction and Footer composed of Shadcn UI components.

Summary:

I'm thinking about [CodeCook.live](https://codecook.live) as a code-first writing and publishing platform, a place to build projects starting from zero to launch and beyond. I'm planning to start with making it easy to take code commits for your project and publish as post threads on social media or blog posts on dev sites.

Once I’ve got that going, I'll start adding features for it to become the world’s first publishing platform for live coding. Lots to do!
